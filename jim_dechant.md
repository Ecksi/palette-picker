## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.
  * Create a project folder as a place to save palettes
  * Save a generated palette to a project folder
  * Delete a palette from a project folder, which removes it from the page and database
  * Never need to refresh the page to see new information

I don't remember when but I felt like I paniced and froze for this project. I have been having a hard time continuing forward. But it all boils down to I did not finish these pieces because I did not use my time well, instead of fretting and freaking out I should have reached out and made a plan. I think I've gotten a grasp on my sanity and will be working on this through-out the weekend to get it to an acceptable level for my own understanding.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

  * No extensions done.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/Ecksi/palette-picker/blob/fffef6ab629e00c8708c3001c56847df0ee7b4e1/public/js/scripts.js#L20)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
  * This was pretty quick and easy to find online, but I enjoyed pulling this apart to understand how it works.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code]() all of the code I didn't finish

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
  * I do not feel awesome about the pieces of functionality I am missing because we all had the same amount of time and I had a huge gap in my project compared to others. Definitely not something I am proud of and I am doing my damnedest to get my mind out of this funk.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

[Design Inspiration](http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/palette-picker-wireframe.png)

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it
  * I used the wireframes provided by Turing for my inspiration. To try and add more life to the cards and general layout I played around with some properties I have not used before, mainly the inset feature of box-shadow and background-clip.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I am not feeling good about my start to mod 4, this is part of the reason I wanted to leave at the end of mod 3. I burned out last mod and my fear was that it would effect my future learning if I couldn't pull myself out of this burnout mode, and I am living my nightmare right now seeing everything start to crack and crumble.. I need to get some damage control going on and muster the energy to do one more push. Sorry to let y'all down =/
